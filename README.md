# Filereader

This project is a sample app to demonstrate the FileReader api. It allows you to select a CSV file from your local file system and then displays it in a grid format. This is achieved without a round trip to the server (i.e. it is all client side). 

Once running, click on the "Choose" button to select a file from your filesystem. 

Then click on "Upload" to read the file and process it locally. Upload in this context, means to your browser, not to any backend server. 

The sample uses the PrimeNg components for the file upload control and the grid display. 

Checked in Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
